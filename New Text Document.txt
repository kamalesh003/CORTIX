Critical Problem: Real-Time Prediction and Prevention of Neurological Crises in Epilepsy Patients Using Distributed Neuromorphic-Semantic Networks
The Billion-Dollar Challenge

Epilepsy affects 50 million people globally, with 30% resistant to medication. The inability to predict seizures leads to:

    Life-threatening situations (SUDEP kills 1 in 1,000 epilepsy patients annually)

    $15.5B/year in emergency healthcare costs (US alone)

    Lost productivity from unplanned incapacitation

Current solutions (medication, implanted neurostimulators) fail because:

    Generic treatment ignores individual neural patterns

    Cloud-dependent systems have critical latency (5-10s)

    Lack of contextual integration (sleep, stress, biomarkers)

NeuroSemantic Solution: CortiX

A wearable neuromorphic-semantic system that:

    Predicts seizures 3-5 minutes in advance (vs current 30s)

    Reduces false positives by 60% through contextual awareness

    Delivers targeted neurostimulation with 10ms latency

    Continuously adapts to patient's evolving neurology
